const TEXT_MODULE_CONTENT = "# QQ Adapter Instructions (Direct Mode)\n\n## Capability Scope\n\n- Handles message ingress and sending for the official QQ bot gateway over WebSocket.\n- Inbound messages are mapped by the chat plugin runtime to an internal `sessionId`, which is randomly assigned and persisted.\n\n## Usage Constraints\n\n- In direct mode, your assistant text output is automatically sent to the current QQ conversation.\n- QQ outbound replies depend on inbound message context such as `chatType` and `messageId`. For cross-conversation sending, use chat plugin actions instead of writing `chatKey` in direct metadata.\n- Group messages are ingested in full by default and do not require an `@` mention.\n- The adapter filters bot self-loop messages and deduplicates inbound messages to avoid \"replying to itself\" loops.\n";
