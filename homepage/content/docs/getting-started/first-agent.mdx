# Create Your First Agent

In this tutorial, you'll build a complete AI agent that can have conversations, remember information, and learn from a knowledge base. We'll start simple and gradually add more sophisticated features.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- [Installed downcity](/docs/getting-started/installation)
- [Completed the quick start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start)
- An OpenAI API key configured

## Step 1: Basic Agent

Let's start with a simple conversational agent.

### Create the Agent File

Create `src/my-first-agent.ts`:

```typescript title="src/my-first-agent.ts"
import 'dotenv/config';
import { Hero } from 'downcity';

async function createBasicAgent() {
  console.log("🤖 Creating your first agent...\n");

  // Create a Hero with a specific personality
  const hero = Hero.create()
    .avatar(`You are Alex, a friendly and knowledgeable assistant. 
             You love helping people learn new things and always respond 
             with enthusiasm and clear explanations.`);

  return hero;
}

async function main() {
  const agent = await createBasicAgent();

  // Have a conversation
  console.log("Starting conversation...\n");
  
  const greeting = await agent.chat("Hi there! What's your name?");
  console.log("Agent:", greeting);
  
  const question = await agent.chat("Can you explain what you can do?");
  console.log("Agent:", question);
  
  const followUp = await agent.chat("That sounds great! What's your favorite programming language?");
  console.log("Agent:", followUp);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### Run Your Agent

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🤖 Creating your first agent...

Starting conversation...

Agent: Hi! I'm Alex, your friendly assistant! I'm excited to help you with anything you need...
Agent: I can help you with a wide variety of tasks! I love answering questions, explaining concepts...
Agent: That's a great question! I really enjoy TypeScript because it brings type safety to JavaScript...
```

## Step 2: Add Memory Persistence

Now let's give your agent the ability to remember conversations across sessions.

### Update Your Agent

Modify `src/my-first-agent.ts`:

```typescript title="src/my-first-agent.ts"
import 'dotenv/config';
import { Hero, SQLitePersistor } from 'downcity';

async function createAgentWithMemory() {
  console.log("🧠 Creating agent with persistent memory...\n");

  // Create a persistor for memory storage
  const persistor = new SQLitePersistor('./alex-memory.db');

  // Create Hero with memory
  const hero = Hero.create()
    .avatar(`You are Alex, a friendly assistant who remembers previous conversations.
             Always acknowledge what you remember about the user when appropriate.`)
    .memory(persistor);

  return hero;
}

async function demonstrateMemory() {
  const agent = await createAgentWithMemory();

  console.log("=== First Conversation ===");
  
  // First conversation - introduce yourself
  let response = await agent.chat("Hi Alex! My name is Sarah and I'm learning TypeScript.");
  console.log("Agent:", response);
  
  response = await agent.chat("I'm working on a web application project.");
  console.log("Agent:", response);
  
  console.log("\n=== Simulating New Session ===");
  
  // Create a new agent instance (simulating a new session)
  const newSessionAgent = await createAgentWithMemory();
  
  // The agent should remember previous conversation
  response = await newSessionAgent.chat("Hi Alex, it's me again. Do you remember what I'm working on?");
  console.log("Agent:", response);
  
  response = await newSessionAgent.chat("Can you give me some TypeScript tips for my project?");
  console.log("Agent:", response);
}

async function main() {
  await demonstrateMemory();
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### Test Memory Persistence

Run the agent twice to see memory in action:

```bash
# First run
npm run dev

# Wait a moment, then run again
npm run dev
```

The agent should remember information from the previous session!

## Step 3: Add Knowledge Base

Let's give your agent access to a knowledge base using Codex.

### Create Knowledge-Enhanced Agent

Create `src/smart-agent.ts`:

```typescript title="src/smart-agent.ts"
import 'dotenv/config';
import { Hero, Codex, SQLitePersistor } from 'downcity';

async function setupKnowledgeBase() {
  console.log("📚 Setting up knowledge base...\n");

  // Create a Codex instance for knowledge storage
  const codex = Codex.create({
    tableName: "alex_knowledge"
  });

  // Add programming knowledge
  await codex.add("TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript", {
    category: "programming",
    topic: "typescript",
    difficulty: "beginner"
  });

  await codex.add("React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially web applications", {
    category: "programming", 
    topic: "react",
    difficulty: "beginner"
  });

  await codex.add("Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine", {
    category: "programming",
    topic: "nodejs", 
    difficulty: "beginner"
  });

  await codex.add("Async/await is a syntax that makes it easier to work with promises in JavaScript", {
    category: "programming",
    topic: "javascript",
    difficulty: "intermediate"
  });

  await codex.add("REST APIs use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform operations", {
    category: "programming",
    topic: "api",
    difficulty: "intermediate"
  });

  return codex;
}

async function createSmartAgent() {
  console.log("🎓 Creating intelligent agent with knowledge base...\n");

  // Set up knowledge base
  const codex = await setupKnowledgeBase();
  
  // Create memory persistor
  const persistor = new SQLitePersistor('./smart-alex-memory.db');

  // Create Hero with both memory and knowledge
  const hero = Hero.create()
    .avatar(`You are Alex, an expert programming tutor. You have access to a knowledge base
             and can remember previous conversations. Always provide helpful, accurate information
             and reference your knowledge when answering questions.`)
    .memory(persistor)
    .study(codex);

  return { hero, codex };
}

async function demonstrateSmartAgent() {
  const { hero: agent, codex } = await createSmartAgent();

  console.log("=== Testing Knowledge-Based Responses ===\n");

  // Ask questions that will trigger knowledge base searches
  let response = await agent.chat("Hi Alex! I'm new to web development. Can you explain what TypeScript is?");
  console.log("Agent:", response);
  console.log("\n" + "=".repeat(50) + "\n");

  response = await agent.chat("That's helpful! What about React? How does it relate to TypeScript?");
  console.log("Agent:", response);
  console.log("\n" + "=".repeat(50) + "\n");

  response = await agent.chat("I want to build a web API. What should I know about REST APIs?");
  console.log("Agent:", response);
  console.log("\n" + "=".repeat(50) + "\n");

  response = await agent.chat("Can you remember what I said I'm new to? Give me a learning path.");
  console.log("Agent:", response);

  // Clean up
  codex.close();
}

async function main() {
  await demonstrateSmartAgent();
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### Run the Smart Agent

```bash
npx tsx src/smart-agent.ts
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- The agent uses knowledge base information to answer questions
- Responses are more accurate and detailed
- The agent remembers the conversation context
- Knowledge is retrieved automatically based on question relevance

## Step 4: Advanced Features

Let's add some advanced features to make your agent even more capable.

### Multi-Session Agent with Skills

Create `src/advanced-agent.ts`:

```typescript title="src/advanced-agent.ts"
import 'dotenv/config';
import { Hero, Codex, SQLitePersistor } from 'downcity';

class AdvancedAgent {
  private hero: Hero;
  private codex: Codex;
  private persistor: SQLitePersistor;

  constructor() {
    this.persistor = new SQLitePersistor('./advanced-agent.db');
    this.codex = Codex.create({ tableName: "advanced_knowledge" });
    this.hero = Hero.create();
  }

  async initialize() {
    console.log("🚀 Initializing advanced agent...\n");

    // Set up knowledge base with more comprehensive information
    await this.setupKnowledge();

    // Configure the hero
    this.hero
      .avatar(`You are Alex, an advanced AI assistant with the following capabilities:
               - Expert knowledge in programming and web development
               - Ability to remember conversations across sessions
               - Access to a comprehensive knowledge base
               - Helpful, patient, and encouraging personality
               
               Always:
               - Provide practical, actionable advice
               - Reference specific examples when helpful
               - Remember user preferences and previous discussions
               - Ask clarifying questions when needed`)
      .memory(this.persistor)
      .study(this.codex);

    return this;
  }

  private async setupKnowledge() {
    const knowledge = [
      {
        content: "JavaScript closures allow inner functions to access outer function variables",
        metadata: { category: "javascript", difficulty: "intermediate", topic: "closures" }
      },
      {
        content: "Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code",
        metadata: { category: "tools", difficulty: "beginner", topic: "git" }
      },
      {
        content: "Docker containers package applications with their dependencies for consistent deployment",
        metadata: { category: "devops", difficulty: "intermediate", topic: "docker" }
      },
      {
        content: "Database indexing improves query performance by creating efficient data structures",
        metadata: { category: "database", difficulty: "intermediate", topic: "optimization" }
      }
    ];

    for (const item of knowledge) {
      await this.codex.add(item.content, item.metadata);
    }
  }

  async chat(message: string): Promise<string> {
    return await this.hero.chat(message);
  }

  async startNewSession(): Promise<void> {
    // Create a new shot (conversation session)
    this.hero.newShot();
    console.log(`📝 Started new session: ${this.hero.getCurrentShotId()}\n`);
  }

  async listSessions(): Promise<void> {
    const sessions = this.hero.getAllShots();
    console.log("📋 Available sessions:");
    sessions.forEach(session => {
      console.log(`  - ${session.id}: ${session.meta.title || 'Untitled'}`);
    });
    console.log();
  }

  cleanup(): void {
    this.codex.close();
  }
}

async function demonstrateAdvancedFeatures() {
  const agent = await new AdvancedAgent().initialize();

  console.log("=== Session 1: Learning JavaScript ===\n");
  
  let response = await agent.chat("Hi Alex! I'm learning JavaScript and I keep hearing about closures. Can you explain them?");
  console.log("Agent:", response);
  console.log("\n" + "=".repeat(50) + "\n");

  response = await agent.chat("Can you give me a practical example of when I'd use closures?");
  console.log("Agent:", response);
  console.log("\n" + "=".repeat(50) + "\n");

  // Start a new session
  await agent.startNewSession();
  console.log("=== Session 2: Development Tools ===\n");

  response = await agent.chat("Now I want to learn about development tools. What's Git and why should I use it?");
  console.log("Agent:", response);
  console.log("\n" + "=".repeat(50) + "\n");

  response = await agent.chat("Do you remember what I was learning about before? Can you connect Git to that topic?");
  console.log("Agent:", response);
  console.log("\n" + "=".repeat(50) + "\n");

  // List all sessions
  await agent.listSessions();

  agent.cleanup();
}

async function main() {
  await demonstrateAdvancedFeatures();
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Understanding Your Agent

### Architecture Overview

Your agent now has three key components:

1. **Hero**: The main AI agent that handles conversations
2. **Room/Shot**: Memory management system
   - **Shot**: Current conversation context
   - **Room**: Persistent memory across sessions
3. **Codex**: Knowledge base for information retrieval

### Memory Hierarchy

```
Shot (Current conversation)
  ↓
Room (Session memory)  
  ↓
Codex (Long-term knowledge)
```

### Data Flow

1. User sends message
2. Hero processes message with current Shot context
3. Hero searches Codex for relevant knowledge
4. Hero generates response using context + knowledge
5. Conversation is saved to Room for persistence

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've built a sophisticated AI agent. Here's what you can explore next:

### Immediate Improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent doesn't remember across sessions:**
- Check that SQLitePersistor is properly configured
- Verify the database file is being created
- Ensure you're using the same persistor instance

**Knowledge base not working:**
- Confirm Codex is properly initialized
- Check that knowledge was added successfully
- Verify the agent is configured with `.study(codex)`

**Slow responses:**
- Consider using faster models for development
- Implement response caching
- Optimize knowledge base queries

### Performance Tips

- Use appropriate model sizes for your use case
- Implement conversation summarization for long sessions
- Clean up old sessions periodically
- Monitor API usage and costs

Your first agent is now complete and ready for real-world use!
